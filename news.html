                        Chus Mateo, who will be back coaching the team after Pablo Laso tested positive for COVID-19, and Walter Tavares, gave their thoughts on Real Madrid's visit to Olimpia Milan for the EuroLeague round 15 game (8:30pm CET). The assistant coach said: "They're a team with quality players like Sergio Rodríguez, Melli, Delaney, Shields, Hines... They're very well-balanced and have a lot of strengths, both defensively and offensively. We know that Milan is not an easy place to play. Their crowd gets behind them the fact they're playing a side immediately above them in the table will give them extra motivation. We have to be switched on and not lose our focus at any time".
